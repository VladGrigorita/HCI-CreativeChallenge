				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Andrei is a color-blind driver who relies on traffic lights to navigate his daily commute. While he understands the importance of following traffic laws and regulations, he often struggles to distinguish between the colors of the traffic lights, particularly red and green. This can be frustrating and stressful for him, who wants to feel confident and in control while driving, and arrive at his destination safely and efficiently.</p>
				<p>He has tried using various navigation apps and GPS devices to help him navigate traffic, but often finds them difficult to use and unreliable. He knows that his frequent use of these products can help him improve his productivity by arriving at work on time, and reduce his transportation costs by using more efficient routes. However, without clear and accessible directions, Andrei finds himself feeling anxious and uncertain on the road.</p>
				<p>Despite these challenges, Andrei remains determined to find solutions that work for him. He is open to trying new products and technologies that can help him navigate traffic more easily, and is committed to staying informed about the latest developments in accessibility and usability for color-blind individuals. With the right tools and resources, he believes that he can overcome the challenges of driving with color blindness and achieve his goals on the road.</p>

					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					Even if Mihai is not color-blinded, he may still face challenges in traffic if he encounter a color-blind driver who is struggling to interpret traffic signals. This could impact his ability to arrive at his destination safely and efficiently, while also impacting his personal and business goals related to confidence, stress, productivity, and transportation costs.

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				Mihai is a busy professional who frequently drives to and from work. He values safety, efficiency, and compliance with traffic laws and regulations. He takes pride in his driving abilities and wants to feel confident and in control behind the wheel, even in stressful traffic situations. Mihai also wants to avoid being delayed by traffic violations or accidents, as he needs to arrive at work on time to meet his business goals.
				However, Mihai may face challenges on the road if he encounters a color-blind driver who is unable to distinguish between red and green traffic lights or other color-coded signals. This could cause confusion and anxiety for Mihai, who relies on these signals to navigate traffic safely and efficiently. He may worry about the possibility of traffic mistakes made by people who cannot see the colors of the traffic lights, and the potential impact this could have on his personal and business goals.
				To address these concerns, Mihai may need to take extra precautions when driving, such as staying alert and attentive at intersections, being prepared to slow down or stop unexpectedly, and allowing for extra time in his commute in case of delays. He may also need to be patient and understanding when encountering color-blind drivers on the road, recognizing that they may be facing unique challenges and doing their best to navigate traffic safely.

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Scenario 1: Morning commute to work</p>
			Mihai is driving to work during rush hour traffic. As he approaches an intersection with a traffic light, he notices that the driver in front of him is color-blind. Mihai is frustrated and worried about the safety of the situation. However, he feels more at ease when he realizes that the other person is using a product that provides alternative signals or feedback, such as sound or vibration. The device helps Mihai and the color-blind driver to navigate the intersection safely, and they both continue on their way without incident. End point: Mihai arrives at work on time, feeling confident and safe on the road.
			<p>Scenario 2: Passenger in a car driven by a colorblind friend </p>
			Mihai is a passenger in a car driven by a colorblind friend. They approach an intersection where the traffic light is difficult for the colorblind driver to identify. Mihai's friend becomes visibly anxious and begins to panic, unsure of how to proceed safely. Mihai suggests that they use an assistive technology that he knows can help colorblind people identify traffic lights. With the help of the assistive technology, the colorblind driver is able to safely navigate the intersection without incident. End point: Mihai's friend successfully navigates the intersection with the help of the assistive technology, reducing their anxiety and increasing their confidence in driving.
