    <h1>Color Blindness Problem</h1>
    <h2>1.Introduction</h2>
    <p >The usability problem with traffic light for colorblind people is that they cannot easily distinguish between red and green traffic lights, 
        which can lead to confusion and dangerous situations. Color blindness can make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between certain colors, 
        such as red and green. This can confuse people who rely on color as a visual cue to understand traffic light status. 
        If you do not know the color of the traffic light, it is easy to make a mistake when entering an intersection, increasing the risk of an accident. 
        Current traffic light designs do not provide an accessible way for people with color blindness to determine traffic light status. 
        This can create accessibility issues and prevent these individuals from using the system effectively. 
        Different intersections may use slightly different shades and patterns for traffic lights, 
        which can be confusing for colorblind people accustomed to certain designs.</p>
    <h2>2.Context of use+Main Audience+Empiric Laws</h2>
    <h3>Context of use</h3>
    <p>To address this problem, an app designed for people with color blindness can help them to navigate traffic more safely and confidently. 
        The app can use the camera on the user's smartphone to detect traffic signals and then provide them with a color-coded interpretation that they can easily understand. 
        The app can also use audio cues to alert the user when a traffic signal changes, which can be particularly useful for those who are visually impaired. 
        By providing people with color blindness with a reliable tool to interpret traffic signals, this app can help them to travel more independently and confidently, 
        reducing the risk of accidents and improving their overall quality of life.</p>
    <h3>Main Audience</h3>
    <p>The main audience for an app that helps people with color blindness in traffic would be individuals who have been diagnosed with some form of color blindness, 
        particularly those who struggle with distinguishing between red and green. This could include people of all ages, 
        from teenagers learning to drive to elderly individuals who rely on public transportation to get around.</p>
    <p>
        In particular, the app could be helpful for individuals who live in urban areas with high levels of traffic, 
        as well as for those who frequently travel to unfamiliar places where they may not be familiar with the layout of the 
        streets or the timing of traffic signals. The app could also be beneficial for people who have jobs that require them to drive 
        or spend a lot of time on the road, such as truck drivers or delivery personnel.</p>
    <p>
        Moreover, the app could be used by family members or caregivers of individuals with color blindness, 
        who may be concerned about their safety when navigating traffic. By providing a reliable and easy-to-use tool to interpret traffic signals, 
        the app can help give peace of mind to those who care for people with color blindness. 
        Overall, the app could be a valuable resource for anyone with color blindness who wants to travel more safely and confidently in traffic.</p>
    <h3>Empiric Laws</h3>
    <h4>Fitts' Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. 
        In the case of traffic lights, the size and placement of the lights can affect how quickly and accurately colorblind individuals can perceive them.</p>
    <h4>Hick's Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases. This can be applied to the design of traffic lights, 
        as having too many options or visual distractions can make it harder for colorblind individuals to distinguish between the red and green lights.</p>
    <h4>Steering Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time it takes to make a steering movement is a function of the size of the target and the angle between the starting position and the target. 
        This can be applied to the design of traffic lights to ensure that the lights are easily visible and distinguishable from different angles and distances.</p>
    <h2>3.Metaphors/Idioms+Affordances+Visual variables</h2>
    <h3>Metaphors and idioms</h3>
    <p>One possible metaphor for traffic lights that could be more easily distinguishable for colorblind individuals is to use different shapes for the lights, 
        such as triangles for red lights and circles for green lights.</p>
    <h3>Affordances</h3>
    <p>Providing a sound or vibration cue along with the visual cues of traffic lights could help colorblind individuals more easily identify which light is currently illuminated</p>
    <h3>Visual variables</h3>
    <p>Increasing the brightness or contrast of the red and green lights could help colorblind individuals more easily distinguish between the two.</p>

    <h2>4.Better design solutions</h2>
        <h3>High Contrast Design</h3>
            <p>A design based on high contrast colours would make it easier for color blind people to see the different features of the app as well as clear and intuitive icons and text lables, that can offer information without relying solely on color.</p>
        <h3>Customizable Colors</h3>
            <p>The app should include customizable color schemes that users can adjust to their own preferences and accommodate their specific type of color blindness.</p>
         <h3>Audio alerts and vocal commands</h3>
         <p>The use of audio alerts and notifications, as well as vocal commands can provide users with an additional method of navigating the app. Also, it can be useful in traffic as it is illegal for the driver to actually use the phone.</p>

    <h2>5.Use of empirical laws of interaction+Affordances+Flow</h2>
        <h3>Use of empirical laws of interaction</h3>
            <h4>Hick's Law</h4>
            <p>Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases.
              By using a simpler design and limiting the number of options the user has when interactiong with the app, the app can downsize the time necessary in the decision-making process.</p>
            <h4>Fitts's Law</h4>
            <p>Fitts' Law states that the time it takes to reach a target is proportional to the distance to the target and the size of the target.
               And since the size and placement of the lights can affect how quickly and accurately colorblind individuals can perceive them, bigger and brighter traffic lights would be a great solution.</p>
            <h4>Steering Law</h4>
            <p>This law states that the time it takes to make a steering movement is a function of the size of the target and the angle between the starting position and the target. 
               Since this law can be applied to the design of traffic lights is would ensure that the lights are easily visible and distinguishable from different angles and distances, making driving safer and easier for color blind individuals.</p>
        <h3>Affordances</h3>
            <h4>Improved Traffic Lights</h4>
            <p>Providing a sound or vibration cue along with the visual cues of traffic lights could help colorblind individuals more easily identify which light is currently illuminated.</p>
        <h3>Flow</h3>
            <p>Regarding the flow of the app, an option wouldbe for the user to be able to customize the color display, if they prefer a different color combination than the default display or depending on the type of color blindness they posses. The app can also provide voice alerts for upcoming turns, road conditions, and other important information that the user may need while driving. Also, traffic lights could not only reflect colours but also symbols, making it easier for color blind individuals to understand traffic signals.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Colorblind people cannot easily distinguish between red and green traffic lights, which can lead to confusion and dangerous situations. By adressing and finding a solution to this problem, not only it would improve the life of the targeted individuals, but also improve the safety of other drivers and passangers.</p>
