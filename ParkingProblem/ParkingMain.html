    <h1>Parking lots problem</h1>
    <h2>1.Introduction</h2>
        <p >Most parking lots in the city don't offer the drivers a way of knowing how many more spaces are available.
         Besides the obvious problem where finding a spot can be stressful and frustrating, this problem can be quite time consuming, especially in zones where aren't many parking lots in the first place.
         Without knowing how many spots are available, drivers may circle the parking lot repeatedly, creating congestion and delays for other drivers trying to get in or out. Also, it can lead to illegal parking: if drivers cannot find a spot, they may resort to parking in unauthorized areas, such as fire lanes or handicap spots. This can lead to fines or towing of vehicles.
        </p>
    <h2>2.Context of use+Main Audience+Empiric Laws</h2>
    <h3>Context of use </h3>
    <p >
        At a busy time of day, it is difficult and takes quite a long time to find a parking space. 
        When you enter a car park you start looking for an empty space, but it can be frustrating and pointless as all the spaces seem to be taken. Moreover, conflicts can arise when there are few spaces available and many cars need to park.
        This effort consumes time, energy and can even affect the driver's mood.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid all these inconveniences, car parks could use a system of counting the cars that already exist in the car park, so that before they enter, they will know how many spaces are free, and if they are all occupied, the barrier will not allow others to enter until a car vacates a space.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Main Audience </h3>
    <p>
        The primary target audience for an application that tracks the number of empty parking spaces is people who need to find available spaces quickly and efficiently. Drivers in a hurry, trying to catch a flight, attending an event or conference, or simply looking for a suitable parking space.
        The app is especially useful for those unfamiliar with the area and parking itself, as it provides real-time updates on parking space availability and makes it easy to find available spaces. This app can be useful not only for individual drivers, but also for large organizations such as airports, shopping malls, and other high-traffic areas. Overall, the main target audience for this type of app is people who want to find a free parking space quickly and easily to save time and relieve stress.  
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Empiric Laws</h3>
    <h4>Fitts' Law</h4>
    <p>
        The app could feature larger buttons or touch areas for commonly-used actions like searching for available parking spots or filtering the results by location or price. This would make it easier for users to navigate the app quickly and efficiently, as they would be able to hit the larger targets more easily and with fewer errors. 
        Also it is important for someoane to be able to acces quickly this kind of application, considering the circumstances. 
        Similarly, the size and spacing of parking spot icons on the app's map could be designed according to Fitts' Law, with larger icons used for parking spots that are more likely to be selected or viewed by users, and smaller icons used for less important or less frequently used areas.
    </p>

    <h4>Hick's Law</h4>
    <p>
        This law states that the time required to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of options or choices presented.
        In the context of an application that tracks the number of free spaces in a car park, this law suggests that the app should present users with a limited set of options or filters to help them quickly find the information they need.
    </p>

    <h4>Steering Law</h4>
    <p>
        This law is particularly relevant for applications that involve continuous movement, such as driving or navigating through a virtual environment. In the context of a car park tracking app, this law could inform the design of the app's interface and controls, to make it easier and more intuitive for users to navigate the map and find available parking spots.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3.Metaphors/Idioms+Affordances+Visual variables</h2>
    <h3>Metaphors and idioms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> A <strong>metaphor</strong> for an app that tracks the number of free spaces in a car park is a "parking radar".
            This metaphor could be used to convey the idea that the app is constantly scanning the area for available parking spots, much like a radar or sensor would detect nearby objects. This could be reinforced by using visual and auditory cues within the app, such as sound effects or visual indicators that represent the scanning and detection process.</li>
        <li>A "parking assistant" is a <strong>metaphor</strong> that could be used to convey the idea that the app is a helpful and personalized assistant that guides users to the best available parking spots. This could be reinforced by using language and messaging within the app that emphasizes the app's ability to provide personalized recommendations and suggestions based on the user's preferences and needs.</li>
        <li>The phrase "finding a needle in a haystack" could be used to describe the challenge of finding an available parking spot in a busy city or crowded area. This <strong>idiom</strong> could be used to emphasize the app's ability to make this process much easier and more efficient, by providing real-time updates and personalized recommendations for available parking spots.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Affordances</h3>
        One important affordance in a car park tracking app is the use of map-based navigation. By using a map interface to display the location of available parking spots, the app can help the user to have a representation of space and navigation, making it easier for them to understand and interact with the app's interface.
    
    <h3>Visual variables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Color is one of the most powerful visual variables, and can be used to convey a wide range of information about parking spots in the app. For example, green could be used to indicate available spots, while red could be used to indicate occupied spots. 
            Other colors could be used to indicate reserved spots (purple) or spots for disabled drivers (yellow).</li>
        <li>The shapes of the icons representing parking spots could be different depending on their availability status. This would help to make it easier for users to quickly scan the map and identify the best available parking spots. </li>
        <li>Larger icons could be used to represent parking spots that are closer to the user's current location or that are otherwise more desirable.</li>
        <li> Arrows or other directional indicators could be used to show users the best route to take to reach the selected parking spot.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4.Better design solutions</h2>
        <h3>Increased Accessible Parking Spaces</h3>
            <p>Increasing the number of accessible parking spaces available in public areas can help to address the problem of parking for 
                people with special needs. This could include designating additional parking spots close to building entrances or other high-traffic areas.</p>
        <h3>Priority Parking</h3>
            <p>Priority parking could be designated for people with special needs, including those who require accessible parking spaces or those who have 
                a valid disabled parking permit. This would help ensure that those who need the parking spaces the most have access to them.</p>
        <h3>Online Reservation Systems</h3>
            <p>An online reservation system could be implemented to allow people with special needs to reserve parking spaces in advance. 
                This could be particularly useful for events or other high-traffic areas where parking may be limited.</p>
        <h3>App-Based Solutions</h3>
            <p>A mobile app could be developed to help people with special needs find and reserve accessible parking spaces. 
                The app could use real-time data to show available parking spaces and provide directions to the closest accessible parking spot.</p>
        <h3>Better Design of Parking Lots</h3>
            <p>Better design of parking lots could help improve accessibility for people with special needs. This could include ensuring that parking spaces 
                are wide enough to accommodate wheelchair users and that there are clear paths of travel to building entrances.</p>
    <h2>5.Use of empirical laws of interaction+Affordances+Flow</h2>
        <h3>Use of empirical laws of interaction</h3>
            <p>The law of interaction suggests that the design of the parking system should take into account the interaction between the user and the system. 
                In this case, the design of accessible parking spaces should be user-centered and take into account the needs of people with special needs. 
                The parking system should provide clear instructions and signage to guide the user through the parking process, 
                and the user should be able to easily access and exit the parking space.</p>
        <h3>Affordances</h3>
            <p>Affordances suggests that the design of the parking system should provide clear cues and feedback to the user about what actions are possible 
                and how they should be performed. For example, parking spaces designated for people with special needs should be clearly marked 
                with universally recognized symbols and signage, so that users can easily identify them. Additionally, 
                the parking system should provide clear feedback to users, such as confirmation that their parking permit has been recognized and that 
                they are parked in a designated accessible space.</p>
        <h3>Flow</h3>
            <p>The flow suggests that the parking system should be designed to provide a smooth and efficient experience for users. 
                This could include designing the parking lot layout to minimize travel distance between the parking space and building entrances, 
                providing additional parking spaces in high-traffic areas, and implementing an online reservation system to reduce wait times and improve 
                overall flow. Additionally, enforcement and penalties for drivers who abuse accessible parking spaces can help to ensure that 
                the system flows smoothly for those who truly need it.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, by applying these empirical laws to the design of parking systems for people with special needs, we can create a more user-centered, 
                intuitive, and efficient parking experience that meets the needs of all users.</p>
