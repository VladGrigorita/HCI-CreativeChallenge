    <h1>Color Blindness Problem</h1>
    <h2>1.Introduction</h2>
    <p >Public transportation plays a crucial role in providing mobility to people of all abilities. 
        However, for individuals who are blind or have mobility impairments, navigating public transportation systems can be a daunting and challenging experience. 
        These individuals often face barriers such as inaccessible routes, confusing signage, and a lack of assistive technology that can make using public transit difficult or even impossible. 
        Such challenges not only limit their ability to access essential services, but also contribute to social isolation and exclusion. 
        Therefore, it is essential to address the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and create a more inclusive and accessible public transportation system for all.</p>
    <h2>2.Context of use+Main Audience+Empiric Laws</h2>
    <h3>Context of use</h3>
    <p>To address this problem, an app designed especially for blind people, as well as individuals with mobility impairments, to help them navigate the city would be a good solution.  
        The app offers a user-friendly interface with voice commands, large text, and high contrast colors for easy visibility. 
        Using the app, users can find their current location and explore nearby bus stops, and be offered real-time audio schedules. 
        The app provides step-by-step audio directions to their destination.
        The app should alert the users when they are approaching their stop or need to transfer to a new route. 
        They can also set reminders for their return trip or any future travel.
        Furthermore, the app can provide information about accessibility features available in public transportation, including priority seating or boarding, ramps, and announcements.
        By providing people a reliable tool to help them navigate the city, this app can help them travel more independently and confidently.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Audience</h3>
    <p>The main audience for an app designed for blind people to help them with public transportation would be individuals who are diagnosed with a type of visual deficiency as well as people with any type of mobility related problems, as it provides information about the accessibility features of the chosen vehicle</p>
    <p>
        In particular, the app could be helpful for individuals who live in urban areas and need to use the public transportation frequently to go to different locations as well as people who are in a diffent area or city than the one they are used to.
        Overall, the app could be a valuable resource for every visually impaired person that wants to use public transportation.</p>
    
    <h3>Empiric Laws</h3>
    <h4>Fitts' Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. 
        Fitts' Law would not be directly applicable for all the targeted audience.
        However, some principles of Fitts' Law, such as targeting and feedback, could still be relevant to the design of an app for blind users. 
        For example, the app should have large, clear targets for buttons and menus, and provide auditory feedback.</p>
    <h4>Hick's Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases. 
        The app should present a limited number of buttons and at any given time to reduce decision-making time and improve the user's experience, the design of the app focusing on simplicity and clarity,</p>
    <h4>Steering Law</h4>
    <p>This law states that the time it takes to make a steering movement is a function of the size of the target and the angle between the starting position and the target. 
        This can be applied to the app by using a design with clear and also audible instructions, large and high contrast text, and easy-to-use navigation for those using assistive technology.</p>
    
    <h2>3.Metaphors/Idioms+Affordances+Visual variables</h2>
    <h3>Metaphors and idioms</h3>
    <p> A <strong>metaphor</strong> for the presented app would be a "helping hand". 
        This should represent the change this app should bring to both the main audience of the app as well as the city, since this would mean a new step in it's improvement.</p>
    <h3>Affordances</h3>
    <p>One important affordance in the app is the ability to locate the user and provide a real-time schedule and location of the vehicles.</p>
    <h3>Visual variables</h3>
    <p>Vehicles and bus station shown in the app could be represented by diffent colours, based on how accessible they are and the services they provide.
    </p>

    <h2>4.Better design solutions</h2>
        <h3>Audio guidance</h3>
            <p>Audio guidance systems can be installed on buses and trains to provide spoken instructions and announcements that help blind individuals navigate the public transportation system more easily. 
                Audio cues can also be added in stations, so that a blind person can hear when a bus is arriving, and which line is it.</p>
        <h3>tactile signage</h3>
            <p>Braille and tactile signage can be added to public transportation stations, stops, and vehicles to provide information such as directions, schedules, and safety guidelines. 
                In this way, blind people can rely on themselves to move in the desired direction. Also, the corresponding numbers can be incorporated on the seats in the bus,
                so the passenger always knows which part of the vehicle they are in, to make it easier for them to choose the door to get off at their destination. </p>
        <h3>Vibrations</h3>
            <p>Vibrating alerts can be incorporated into mobile applications or wearable devices to alert blind individuals when they are 
                approaching their destination or when a bus or train is arriving. With training at the beginning of using the app,
                 they can learn the type of vibrations and their duration, to understand when the expected bus is approaching or when they arrive at the desired stop. </p>
    <h2>5.Use of empirical laws of interaction+Affordances+Flow</h2>
        <h3>Use of empirical laws of interaction</h3>
            <p>Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases.
                By simplifying the menu options presented in transportation kiosks or mobile apps, blind individuals can more easily and efficiently access the information they need.</p>
            <p>Fitts' Law states that the time it takes to reach a target is proportional to the distance to the target and the size of the target, so
                by increasing the size of buttons on transportation kiosks or mobile apps, blind individuals could more easily navigate the interface and complete their desired actions.</p>
        <h3>Affordances</h3>
            <h4>Tactile flooring</h4>
            <p> Tactile flooring can be installed in public transportation stations and stops to provide tactile cues that help blind individuals navigate the space more easily.
                  A tactile strip can be installed along the edge of a platform to indicate the location of the platform edge, while textured tiles can be used to indicate changes in direction or elevation.
                  The use of tactile flooring provides physical affordance by providing tactile cues that suggest the purpose and function of different parts of the space.
                  The tactile cues provided by the flooring can help blind individuals orient themselves in the space and navigate the environment more effectively.</p>
        <h3>Flow</h3>
            <p>Consistent and intuitive wayfinding can help improve the flow of public transportation systems for blind individuals.
                For example, using consistent signage and tactile markers can help blind individuals navigate public transportation stations and stops more easily.
                In addition, providing clear and concise directions through audio announcements can help blind individuals understand where they need to go and how to get there.
                By creating a consistent and intuitive wayfinding system, blind individuals can more easily navigate public transportation systems and move through the environment with greater ease and efficiency.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the daily movement of blind people can be improved and simplified by different technologies involving the other senses.
                Through audio and vibrating messages and tactile signalling, they could move more easily, comfortably and independently. </p>
